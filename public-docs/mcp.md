# MCP reference

Agents launched by Paseo get this catalog by default ([turn it off](/docs/orchestration#get-started)). Ask for an outcome in natural language, or use the tool interfaces below.

## Configuration

| Setting                       | Default | Purpose                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `daemon.mcp.enabled`          | `true`  | Run the MCP server.                                |
| `daemon.mcp.injectIntoAgents` | `true`  | Give agents launched by Paseo access to its tools. |

Depending on the provider, Paseo delivers tools through its native tool interface or MCP. The capabilities are the same. Start a new agent or reload an existing one after changing injection settings.

## Limit Paseo tools by provider

Use provider policies when different agent profiles should receive different Paseo tools. Enable
tool injection globally, then add `paseoTools` to the exact provider IDs you launch:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://paseo.sh/schemas/paseo.config.v1.json",
  "version": 1,
  "daemon": {
    "mcp": {
      "enabled": true,
      "injectIntoAgents": true
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "providers": {
      "codex-lead": {
        "extends": "codex",
        "label": "Codex Lead"
      },
      "codex-worker": {
        "extends": "codex",
        "label": "Codex Worker",
        "paseoTools": {
          "disabledTools": ["create_agent", "send_agent_prompt", "kill_agent"]
        }
      },
      "codex-isolated": {
        "extends": "codex",
        "label": "Codex Isolated",
        "paseoTools": {
          "enabled": false
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Run `paseo reload` after editing `~/.paseo/config.json`, then start a new agent or reload an
existing one. A running session keeps the catalog it received at launch.

Omitting `paseoTools` enables the complete catalog. Set `enabled` to `false` to remove the catalog,
or list exact tool IDs in `disabledTools` to remove selected tools. Custom profiles do not inherit
this policy from `extends`; configure each custom provider ID separately.

Browser tools still require browser tools to be enabled and a connected browser host. The
voice-only `speak` tool is separate from this policy.

This setting limits the catalog presented to an agent. It is not a security boundary for an agent
that can access the host through a shell.

## Mental model

Workspaces decide where work happens; agent parentage decides who owns the work.

- An agent that calls `create_agent` without a `workspaceId` gets a subagent in its own workspace.
- Passing a `workspaceId` places that subagent in another workspace without detaching it from its parent.
- A top-level MCP caller without a workspace gets a new local workspace.
- Create a workspace first when you need worktree isolation, a specific branch, or a pull request checkout.

MCP does not expose an agent-detach tool. Detaching is a manual user action in the app or CLI.

## Tools

### Agents

| Tool                 | Function                                                                                |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create_agent`       | Create an agent, optionally placing it in an existing workspace with `workspaceId`.     |
| `send_agent_prompt`  | Send a prompt to an existing agent using its `agentId` and a `prompt`.                  |
| `get_agent_status`   | Return the latest snapshot for an agent.                                                |
| `list_agents`        | List recent agents as compact metadata.                                                 |
| `cancel_agent`       | Abort an agent's current run but keep the agent alive.                                  |
| `archive_agent`      | Soft-delete an agent and remove it from the active list.                                |
| `kill_agent`         | Terminate an agent session permanently.                                                 |
| `update_agent`       | Update an agent name, labels, or runtime settings such as mode/model/thinking/features. |
| `get_agent_activity` | Return recent agent timeline entries as a curated summary.                              |
| `set_agent_mode`     | Switch an agent's session mode.                                                         |

### Workspaces

| Tool                | Function                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create_workspace`  | Create a local or worktree-isolated workspace. Worktrees can branch off, check out a branch, or a PR. |
| `list_workspaces`   | List active workspaces and their directories and isolation.                                           |
| `rename_workspace`  | Change the user-visible name of the current or specified workspace.                                   |
| `archive_workspace` | Archive a workspace and the sessions it owns.                                                         |

For worktree isolation, `create_workspace` accepts the same useful choices as the app: branch off from a base, check out an existing branch, or check out a pull request. The worktree remains an implementation detail of the workspace lifecycle.

### Workspace scripts

These tools manage scripts configured in a workspace's `paseo.json`. Each requires an explicit `workspaceId`; start and stop also require the configured `scriptName`.

| Tool                     | Function                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_workspace_scripts` | List configured scripts with lifecycle, terminal, port, proxy URL, and health metadata. |
| `start_workspace_script` | Start a configured script through Paseo's managed launcher.                             |
| `stop_workspace_script`  | Stop a running script through its supervised terminal.                                  |

See [Git worktrees](/docs/worktrees#scripts-and-services) for `paseo.json` configuration.

### Terminals

| Tool                 | Function                                                                     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_terminals`     | List terminal sessions for one working directory or all working directories. |
| `create_terminal`    | Create a terminal session for a working directory.                           |
| `kill_terminal`      | Kill a terminal session.                                                     |
| `capture_terminal`   | Capture plain-text output from a terminal session.                           |
| `send_terminal_keys` | Send text or special key tokens to a terminal session.                       |

### Schedules and heartbeats

Both use the same cron engine, but they have deliberately different interfaces.

| Tool                | Function                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create_schedule`   | Create a cron schedule that starts a new agent for each run.                 |
| `list_schedules`    | List new-agent schedules managed by the daemon.                              |
| `inspect_schedule`  | Inspect a schedule and its run history.                                      |
| `pause_schedule`    | Pause an active schedule.                                                    |
| `resume_schedule`   | Resume a paused schedule.                                                    |
| `update_schedule`   | Change a schedule's cron, prompt, agent settings, limits, or other settings. |
| `schedule_logs`     | Return recent runs and output for a schedule.                                |
| `run_schedule_once` | Start one new-agent schedule run without changing its cron.                  |
| `delete_schedule`   | Delete a new-agent schedule permanently.                                     |
| `create_heartbeat`  | Send a recurring cron-backed prompt into the current agent.                  |
| `delete_heartbeat`  | Delete one of the current agent's heartbeats.                                |

MCP heartbeats are ephemeral: create or delete them. To change one, delete it and create a replacement. Pause, resume, update, inspect, logs, and run-once apply to new-agent schedules only.

### Agent profiles

| Tool            | Function                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_profiles` | Return the host's saved agent profiles, including their notes and launch settings. Returns an empty list when none are configured. |

Before delegating, read each profile's `notes` and choose the profile the user named or the one that fits the task. See [Agent profiles](/docs/agent-profiles) for setup and example notes.

`create_agent` has no profile parameter and requires a `provider/model` pair. If the profile has no model, call `list_models` for its provider and choose an available model for the task before launching. Apply the chosen profile's values to the launch request:

| Profile field                   | `create_agent` field                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `provider` and optional `model` | `provider` as `provider/model`, using the saved or discovered model ID      |
| `modeId`                        | `settings.modeId`                                                           |
| `thinkingOptionId`              | `settings.thinkingOptionId`                                                 |
| `featureValues`                 | `settings.features`                                                         |
| `notes`                         | Selection guidance for the orchestrator; supply the task in `initialPrompt` |

Omit absent optional settings. If no profile fits, use provider discovery to choose available settings.

### Providers

| Tool               | Function                                                          |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_providers`   | List configured agent providers, availability, and modes.         |
| `list_models`      | List models for an agent provider.                                |
| `inspect_provider` | Inspect compact provider capabilities and draft feature settings. |

### Permissions

| Tool                       | Function                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_pending_permissions` | Return pending permission requests across agents. |
| `respond_to_permission`    | Approve or deny a pending permission request.     |

### Visuals

| Tool           | Function                                                                                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `html_preview` | Check a page at a chosen width and receive a PNG, content height, and console output.        |
| `html_render`  | Publish a self-contained HTML page inline in the agent's conversation above its final reply. |

Check a page with `html_preview` before publishing it. The first preview on a supported daemon may install its pinned browser; if installation is still running, call the tool again in a minute. Use `paseo browser status` or `paseo browser setup` to inspect or prepare that browser. Preview uses Paseo's stock light or dark theme; a reader's custom theme can differ. Pages with measured widths grow to fit narrower phone layouts up to the 2,000 px frame limit. A smaller requested `height` intentionally scrolls inside the frame.

The page follows the app's light or dark theme through CSS variables, and can include local images from the agent's working directory or OS temp directory. HTTPS scripts, styles, images, fonts, and media can load from any host; these requests can send data in the page to that host. The page contains only what the agent wrote, and the agent already has that data and network access. `connect-src 'none'` blocks fetch, XHR, and WebSocket, not all network access. The page stays available in archived conversations and is removed when the agent is permanently deleted.

Codex agents can also use their bundled `visualize` workflow. Its file references display inline without an `html_render` call; use one route for each visual. The source file must remain in the agent's workspace or its own Codex visualization directory for archived history to display it. Paseo restores that visual's saved widget state when it is opened again. Tabs, tooltips, carousels, and Lucide icons work in these fragments. The bundled `<viz-calendar>` widget and Tweak panel are not yet supported.

### Browser

Browser automation is opt-in and adds tools for opening tabs, reading pages, clicking, typing, and taking screenshots. See the [Browser tools reference](/docs/browser-tools).

### Voice

| Tool    | Function                                                                                  |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `speak` | Speak text through daemon-managed voice output. Available only in voice-enabled sessions. |
